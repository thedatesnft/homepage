Do you have a really special, memorable day in your life? And do you
want to send a message that is stored forever for that day?

That's why we created The Dates NFT.
## What are the The Dates NTFs?

The Dates NFT is a collection of 366 works. Each work includes a
specific date and a message with a maximum length of 128 characters
written for that date. Owning a work allows you to change the
content of the message multiple times.
## How much is it?

The first mint starts at 0.01 ETH. After each mint the price of the
next mint will be multiplied by 1.1, until it reaches the capped
value of 2 ETH. This means the early buyers will get the cheapest
prices.
## What can I do with the NFT?

After purchasing the NFT, you'll be able to change the message in it
as many times as you want. The NFT will also be available on
Opensea and you'll be able to receive offers for it.
## What will happen once the project is finished?

Once the project has reached its goal (all dates has been filled), each NFT owner will be received a unique and real life Calligraphy with the date content they own.
